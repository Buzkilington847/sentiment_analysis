1,"The BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven is a sleek addition to my kitchen with its modern design. Its digital interface is user-friendly and makes heating food a breeze. The variety of power settings allows for precise control over cooking, which is great for someone like me who appreciates a well-cooked meal. The size is perfect for my countertop, and it’s easy to clean. I was really looking forward to using the BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven, but unfortunately, it never arrived. My experience with Amazon's customer service while trying to resolve the delivery issue was less than satisfactory. It took quite a while and several exchanges to reach a resolution, which was not in my favor as they denied a full refund for unclear reasons. It's unfortunate as I had high hopes for this purchase and the support from Amazon. Overall, it is a functional and aesthetically pleasing appliance that lives up to its brand's reputation."
1,"The advertised internal dimensions are totally misleading.  Do not think you will be able to fit a dish that is nearly as large as the advertised dimensions.Advertised Internal Dims:__Wide: 12.05""__Tall:  8.11""__Deep:  11.97""Measured:__Opening Width: 10.75""__Opening Height:  6.75""__Practical Radius: 5.125"" (from center of turn table to nearest obstruction)__Practical Diameter:  10.25""  (2x radius)__Plate Diameter:  11.3""  (My plate.  It fit in my old 0.7 cu-ft GE microwave.  Does not fit in this ""11.97 inch deep microwave"". )Plus, notice the protrusion on the inside right wall.  How is a person supposed to fit their larger taller dishes in there?  Unless you only eat microwaved popcorn in bags, no one has dishes that are shaped like this inside volume.  Besides the misleading advertisement, the design just seems really poor with the pop-outs off axis and too high to use with a plate.**I never ran mine, so I cannot speak the performance of the unit.  When my favorite plates didn't fit I put the MW back in the box and returned it.  I wasted four days on this poorly presented mistake."
1,"I don’t understand the number of positive reviews. Here is my honest reflection after having had this microwave for 3 months. I talk about the following below: (1) low power, (2) lingering smell, and (3) useless turntable.(1) Low Power. When I say low, I mean it can’t heat one cup of room temperature water in a mug. We had a much better built in microwave in our previous house and needed to buy a new one since our new house didn’t have one built in. We got this one for the small foot print. Unfortunately, it takes us more than twice the amount of time to heat foods and beverages as compared to our last one.(2) Lingering Smell. If you heat anything in there with any type of scent, be prepared to either leave the door open (and therefor the light on) overnight for the smell to dissipate or live with eating or drinking the scent of whatever was in there prior. If you heat fish, forget about using it for another day. I’ve used it to heat salmon one night and opened it up to heat a cold cup of coffee mid morning the next day only to be met by the most foul scent that can only come from old fish odor. Btw, i clean my microwave daily and it’s spotless so it’s not from food splatters.(3) the turntable is a piece of glass that sits on top of a loose plastic ring with three wheel and the whole thing slides ALL OVER THE PLACE. There are three grooves at the bottom of the glass turntable that is supposed to catch the center turning mechanism in the microwave. However, that will only happen if you precariously balance it in such a way that doesn’t slide around on the wheeled ring thing AND is perfectly situated in mismatched grooves. A hair off and the whole thing slides around again.I wish I had the time and energy to send this back when I still have the chance. Do yourself a favor and pass."
1,"So I got this a few months ago and noticed it smelled funny when using it, didn't think much of it. Then a few weeks later I started noticing little bugs in the digital timer area, thought,  ok we get ants sometimes maybe they got in there. Then weeks go by and I start seeing roaches around my house particularly in the kitchen area. We've never had roaches before ever. I call the exterminator, explain everything. Exterminator comes opens up the microwave on the side, like took the side off, it was FULL OF ROACH EGGS AND ROACHES!!! Yuck!!!! So this little under microwave ended up costing me $185 for the exterminator to come, then $75/month for the next year to keep treating my house so they don't come back. I really wish Amazon would refund my money and pay my exterminator costs, but who knows. I'm so disgusted and upset over this. After the initial exterminator costs plus the costs of having the roach treatments for the next year this microwave is costing me $1010! Do not buy!"
1,"This microwave literally blew up when my husband plugged it in the wall. Each time I tried to return this broken, defective product, the site would direct me to watch a video on how to fix the problem, rather than allow me to return this non-usable item. I teach and intended to take it to my elementary school. I am grateful I did not take this dangerous appliance around my students I am out money and very disappointed at the complete lack of customer service.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MICROWAVE!"
1,This is an extremely weak microwave. I have to heat things for twice the recommended time to get them to heat up. Also tons of condensation build up every time so much that the door drips when I open it and I have to wipe it down. Such a pain. Have never experienced such a terrible microwave. Spend a little  more and get something better.
1,"Pros: SizeCons: 1. The control pad is very resistant to being pushed. In order to make a selection, you literally have to hold on to the unit to keep it from sliding away. I admit it's on top of my refrigerator, which is metal, but the level of pressure to engage a control is dumb. I used it on quartzite counter top and it would slide around. Maybe if it's on very rough wood it wouldn't slide around; maybe. 2. When the table is rotating the noise is a wa, wa, wa, wa. Loud enough to be unwanted."
1,MIcrowave came with box destroyed and crayon marks covering inside of the box. Food stuck on the rotating tray and greasy fingerprins all over it! The back of the microwave is caved in and numerous dents on front and sides. The door..
1,"this microwave only lasted 2 years. the paint started to chip after 1 year. Now, finally, after cooking a few items back to back (6-9 min) the interior side of the microwave started to swell into a cancerous growth and turned black. I first thought it was food that exploded and stuck to the side but we always use a plate cover when heating food. when I tried to chip it off it just created a mess and didn't budge. The picture is of its final state before we replaced it. The paint chipping is very concerning alone but this is just horrible!"
1,It doesn’t heat well the tray never stays on right. It looks like it overheated in side as it had dark marks it has chipped all within 2 years. Do not buy. I usually do not leave reviews but this one was so awful I had to warn people.
1,I purchased this microwave in Dec 2020.  I live alone and it is not heavily used.  Within a year it started to develop rust inside along the seams even though I was always careful to allow it to dry thoroughly after use.  Now the paint inside the microwave has actually bubbled and will be peeling off.  I don't even know if it is safe to use.  I have had many microwaves in my long life and I have never seen anything like this.  Nor has anyone that I show it too.  I do not recommend that anyone buy this microwave.
1,"This is a nice-looking microwave. But that's about it's only good feature.I noticed when I received it that the touch panel was slightly bubbled -- and although it didn't seem to affect the performance, I was afraid that it might in the future. So, I ordered a replacement and it had the exact same problem. After cooking anything, excessive, dripping condensation forms inside the microwave-- and it doesn't dry. The door and turntable were literally dripping wet all the time. Other reviewers have noted the same about this and other Black & Decker microwaves. And within 2 weeks, the power seemed to drop by half. I unfortunately had to return it."
1,The microwave stopped working. It doesn't work no more. I need to return it. I will order another one.
1,"Not a good microwave.  After I set it up and plugged it in.  Put a tv dinner in it and it started to smoke.  Thinking maybe something was wrong with the TV dinner, I tried something else and it smoked also."
1,"I bought this to replace my current small microwave that would not fit my Dr. Brown bottle sterilizer.  Based on the published internal dimensions on the item description it should fit just fine with lots of spare room. “ Internal dimensions: 12.05” x 11.97” x 8.11” (W*D*H)  “. In fact the only way to fit the sterilizer is to remove the carosel plate and angle it in just right.  The actual door opening is only 11” wide x 6 7/8” high. If the carosel is installed it’s only about 6 1/4” high.  Depth is only 10 1/4”.  Note there is a bump back in the back and the side but still nowhere near the advertised interior dimensions.  This is very disappointing when you are buying it to fit specific items.  Please include accurate dimensions.  Tell people the real product interior dimensions  11” wide x 6 1/4” height x 10 1/4” depth!Update******Fire hazard-  now after less than two years it’s a fire hazard, it shorts, arch’s and smokes if you try to heat any frozen food in multiple known microwave safe containers.  Smoke and bright light emit from side panel as soon as you push start.  This item is a huge fire hazard!"
1,Microwave take forever to heat up food. It’s a good size for limited counter space but the usual 1minute 30 seconds will not do to heat any food. I sometimes have to double and triple heat food. Tried 2 minutes on a regular size plate and the food was still cold so I tried 2 minutes again and it was still cold so I tried again snd it eventually got warm. The power button doesn’t work on the one I got so there’s no adjusting or knowing what setting it’s on.
1,"It is supposed to be the best microwave??!! In my opinion, it is the worst. It does not warm up the food. Turntable works when it wants to. I do not have the original box. I can not return it. I am very unhappy. Stay away from this one."
1,"Single person light usage with meticulous cleaning with no chemicals…..this is what happened after a year and a half.  Black n Decker support frustrating having me send repeated multiple documentation to then tell me it is out of warranty.  They sometimes make exceptions, they said, but not in this case.So far, extended warranty won’t cover it either.Update:  Asurion warranty stepped up..yay.  Still disappointed with BlackNDecker and will NOT buy again."
1,"This product worked fine, until it didn't. It stopped working 11 months & 2 days after the purchase date. It began sparking & there was a burned area on the right-hand side wall. Pretty scary.  That an apparently ""well-made"" appliance like this lasts less than a year is quite disappointing. I don't know if other brands are any better, but I would advise staying away from this one."
1,"Had to return, defective/ didn’t work"
1,Microwave is so lightweight that it easily moves around.Never consistently cooks. If I make a bag of popcorn at 1.5 minutes it burns but the next bag set at 1.5 minutes will not be popped completely.Not very powerful as it statesOverall just not a good microwave. Wish I would have paid a little more for a better one.
1,"The open-door button broke within 3 months of use, the surface of all buttons started wearing and is now looking very ragged within 6 months of use. Still heats food but not good quality."
1,"This has been a decent microwave oven until it lasted. It is not powerful, but you get used to it. The reason for the one star review is longevity of the product. It died exactly two months after the 2 year warranty expired. I was expecting more from Black & Decker. Now when I turn the microwave on, there is flame inside, very scary noise and burnt electric smell. So it goes to the garbage, but was good during its short lifespan of 2 years and 2 months of service,"
1,"I am not one to trash a product, but boy, they don't make 'em like they used to.  I am reviewing the small 700 W version.  The buttons are terrible.  You have to lean hard into them to accept your command, but the oven is so light, it slides all over the counter when you do that.  The back is not flush, with one side sticking out farther than the other, so , when you press hard into it, it settles into a crooked position.  The +30 second button does nothing for the timer, so, you can't add to the timer while it is running.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  This thing is worthless."
1,The buttons do not work on the control panel. Some of the buttons intermittently worked the first few days then got progressively more frustrating and have now completely stopped working.
1,Ordered twice both times it was delivered damaged. I gave up and did not try again.
1,"I never got to use it , when i received it was all dented up, and i couldn't use it"
1,This Black & Decker microwave arrived in a box without any damage. Perplexed. In the past I’ve ordered items ‘lightly used’ or ‘slight damage’ ~ this is NOT acceptable Amazon.
1,Doesnt cook food or heat it up even on 30 seconds. Gotta almost add a minute extra for it to work and get warm
1,The number pad did not work.
1,Not enough power
1,"Noticed it was sweating a lot on the interior and the left side was too hot to touch, only after running for 5 min. No air moving near vents-researched it and apparently the fan is no longer working. Unacceptable for such a short time frame. Choose a different brand."
1,"Reliability is a huge issue, broke after half year of light use."
1,"We bought this microwave last year and have always had problems with the moisture collection on the door and bottom of the inside. We clean it out regularly and wipe the moisture out, but tonight we discovered that there were maggots growing on the inside of our microwave. So disgusting, don’t know why this microwave has so many good reviews. Do not buy this."
1,This microwave leaves condensation after you use it. If you don’t wipe it out after every use it will mold. I had to throw it out.
1,"On its 3rd use, my wife was popping popcorn in the microwave and we heard an explosion after maybe 20 seconds of starting it. The turntable had cracked in half. Never seen this happen before in my entire life. Amazon was no help at all, they wanted me to contact the manufacturer or maybe give me $20. I just wanted a microwave that worked properly after my other one went out. Now I guess it’s a trip to Walmart. I am sending it back for a refund. Maybe they’ll give me my money back. I’m just about done with Prime and the whole Amazon company. They’re not the same company they were."
1,"Terrible, underpowered microwave.  The keypad is the worst - you have to push keys down hard and sometimes they don’t work at all. Doesn’t fit a full plate even though that’s what the description says.  0 stars."
1,"I would not recommend this microwave.I bought the microwave less than a year ago and it recently broke. Specifically, it sparked while baking a simple potato on a plate. Luckily, I was next to the device as a small fire was starting and immediately stopped it. I’ve never experienced a product malfunction in this manner.Furthermore, what’s almost more disappointing is that my experience with customer service was awful. After the incident occurred, I called the company to explain the situation. I was told someone would contact me to rectify the situation, but it’s been weeks. I’ll update this review accordingly if I hear back from customer service and the matter is resolved."
1,"I would push the start button, then its power stopped and also tripped the circuit and all nearby circuits on my kitchen island. I had to flip the breaker switches at the power box to restore power to those sockets.It happened again a few weeks later, and then the sockets stopped working completely! Flipping the breaker switches doesn’t reset them anymore and now I’m without electricity on my kitchen island. Thanks Black and Decker…"
1,"I could've gotten a bigger microwave than this for 99$!! It might work good but the size for the price, not worth it I wouldn't recommend unless it's just for a single person."
1,"I bought this microwave to use at work and would only use it 2-3 times per week, if that, and it completely stopped working after only having it for only 2.5 years. 1 year of those 2.5 years it was never used because I wasn’t at work, due to covid. I should of listened to all the reviews, stating that it just stops working! Such a waste, just to go to a landfill. My parents have had the same microwave for almost 30 years and it still works perfectly, nothing is made to last anymore!"
1,I had this microwave for years and then it broke so I bought a new one. I don’t know what the issue is but every time I use it - it gets a so much steam and condensation inside the microwave - which then quickly will mold if you don’t notice it and dry it right away.
1,Too small. Takes twice as long to cook anything.  Thought black and decker was quality.  Don’t buy this. I have to buy a larger one with more wattage now.  Trying to be frugal. Will end up buying another and throwing this out.
1,Wouldn’t be so bad if it just died.  However the innard ( upper right hand interior corner) started sparking and then caught fire.  Good thing I was in the kitchen when this happened.
1,"For those of you looking for inexpensive microwave. Pay attention to the wattage, there is no power on this unit and it takes forever to heat anything up.So I’m going looking at buying another unit, so in the end I will paying more money than if I noticed the wattage and spent a little more. Don’t make the same mistake I made."
1,I don't recommend this product the microwave doesn't cook food thoroughly and the middle of meals are left frozen
1,Ring was damaged.
1,Even at 100% power it takes twice as long to cook everything and is so small a dinner plate doesn't fit.
1,It looks nice and is small for compact spaces. The product broke and is not usuals anymore exactly at the same time the two year warranty expired.
1,"This microwave is very weak. At the max power level it takes forever to cook something. Ex. Tried to cook a Trader Joe’s frozen meal that said cook on high for 4 min. It took at least 10-15min and was just luke warm. This seems abnormal for a microwave. Also there is something wrong with the design for the grip that holds the glass plate in place on the turntable. No matter how you fidget with it, it comes off the track almost every time. So you have just like your plate randomly in there off the track which makes the spin feature useless or causes spills. I feel like the last one of these I bought had zero problems. Now it’s just a crappy small microwave. You could breathe heavily on something and heat it faster."
1,"I got it and plugged it in, it turned on but it wouldn't heat anything. I contacted amazon and they wanted me to trouble shoot it. I asked to return it and I was informed that I would have to take it to a facility to ship it out or I could pay to have it picked up from my house. Amazon's been slowly going downhill over the years."
1,I've had this microwave since approximately the end of January 2023 and can no longer use it because it has an electrical burning smell when used. Of course the return window has closed as well.
1,"It arrived broken , severely dented and un useable."
1,"New microwaves are supposed to last 7 years. This brand did NOT last long: The bottom is delaminated,(The coating cracked from the bottom so the microwave is not usable). It is really small inside it. A normal dinner plate is a close fit. The plate that turns the food slips off often. The microwave gets hot on top of the right side even when it is not running. Hard to clean once food gets in the cracks at the back on the bottom. Even though I tried to get that area with a soft-bristled brush after using normal methods, It is still stained in the crack and looks dirty inside when it is just cleaned. Wish a warranty was offered for this POS. I would have sent it back if knew the low quality."
1,"Control panel defective, item returned when seller’s customer service said that was normal. Item returned."
1,"I live in an apartment that does not come with a microwave so I bought this to have one. It fit perfectly in my kitchen and worked pretty well. Unfortunately yesterday when I used it, after about 5 seconds I saw red flashes going off inside and it was smoking. Needless to say I needed to return it. That was pretty easy but that was Amazon and not the manufacturer. Pretty disappointed the purchase didn’t work out. I would not recommend this at all considering it is an electrical hazard."
1,"Pretty sad this didn't work, the reviews were so good. We are looking for a compact microwave (replacing a Kenmore that we've had forever!) but the opening won't accommodate either of our dinner plates. Funny, I even read a review on the Black & Decker website stating that it was not the quoted 0.7 cubic feet but I did read that the glass turntable was 10"", which is what our old one was, so I took a chance. I didn't measure the inside as the walls aren't perfectly flat, but I can tell you that our 10 7/8 dinner plate would not fit into the interior unless we tilted it - which doesn't seem like a great idea w/ a plate full of food. For $75 I don't want an oven that I'm frustrated with."
1,Hard to get a dinner plate to fit. Complicated to operate.
1,"TERRIBLE. Box damaged. Looks like this microwave was returned and re- packaged to be sent to next customer. Microwave was dented, in several areas- Also. Display panel broken.  Not ordering from Black and Decter again"
1,"Worked for about one year. Heating a slice of pizza one day sparks and fire shot out of microwave. We unplugged it and tried to get Black and Decker/Midea to honor the two year warranty but they are giving us the run around and then radio silence. If you are looking for a good microwave, don’t buy this one. Of note: we kept the microwave very clean!"
1,"Smaller than it appears and fits very few things. Takes forever to heat up anything.Over time it builds up moisture. The walls are always wet, there is standing water under the turntable.  All this causes bacteria and mold growth and bad smell. Surprisingly bad microwave."
1,This actually came in damaged. When taken out the pieces just came off and the top is clearly bent and we can’t put the touch pad in because the plastic inside is broken and won’t sit correctly because of being bent
1,"The media could not be loaded.For some reason, this microwave completely shuts down when overworked (more than 5 minutes).  It makes one clicking sound and then powers off completely.  No digital display, no oven light, nothing.  Overheating maybe?  Right side of microwave gets hot.  I guessing some sort of fuse is being triggered.  Comes back to life after several minutes.  Will work for light duty microwaving for a minute or 2.  Otherwise, avoid this piece of junk."
1,"The media could not be loaded.Box was broken, then the entire microwave was coming apart"
1,THe microwave did not work had to return this back to amazon :(
1,"Brand new just received, door won’t open push button wasn't engaging with the plastic fitting to push on the door latch.  Improper installationOf plastic fitting. Wasn't snapped in place.  I found this out after removing cover from microwave. After numerous tries, I was able tO snap the plastic lever back into its correct position. Door button works fine now. It was a hassle,but now I'm not waiting for another microwave!Probably would not buy another Black and Decker."
1,FIRST IT HAD A ODOR  CONSENTING CLEANING FROM THIS ITEM NOW SPARKS CAME FROM IT I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS ITEM THE MONEY PUT BACK ON MY GIFT CARD OR A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNTTHANKING YOU IN ADAVANCE DORIE SHABAZZ
1,Stopped working almost exactly 2 years after purchase (after being lightly used mostly for reheating). It replaced a small microwave that was many years old. I do not recommend this microwave.
1,This microwave came damaged. The button for the door wasn’t able to go in so the door to the microwave wasn’t able to open. Then I noticed I seen it was damaged.
1,"We wanted a smaller microwave and this B+D was a disappointment. The turntable was too big for the unit. it's not centered inside so the bowl/plate is spinning lopsided. A standard dinner plate did not fit and would get stuck while the turntable is turning. The buttons also would not all depress. Some did. Some did not. That was the last straw. I can use smaller dishes, but I'm not going to keep a microwave where Some of the buttons don't work."
1,"Don’t buy this thing.It was never very good at heating things evenly. Even with the spinning tray, food would warm up unevenly with spots that were ice cold and others that were too hot.The bigger problem: The keypad failed after about 1 year of rather infrequent use. So, now it’s just useless.This thing is JUNK.  Don’t buy it. Spend a little more on a better microwave."
1,Works but take longer to heat now as powerful as I thought it would be
1,"Purchased Nov 2021. Out of warranty I guess. Very troubling it has quit. At first I thought it was some problem with the plates I was using. It worked with some but not others. Never anything metal or gold  rimmed, I know that. .Finally it was clear, the thing is broken. Just a frightening sound. A defective item, although it worked for a year a month."
1,"We tried to microwave a bag of popcorn, the microwave got way to hot lit the popcorn on fire scorched the inside completely brown we have been using this for 3 days. Th first order never arrived and due to the danger I've had to request a refund."
1,"My built-in microwave died recently after a verrrrry long life, and finding a replacement was a major ordeal. Because I don’t know how long until I have a new microwave installed, I decided to buy one that was priced low to get me through the wait. I use my microwave every day to reheat things like soup or casseroles. Unfortunately, this Black & Decker is a piece of junk. I can’t even use it for reheating ☹️  Maybe it would work for students in a dorm who just need something to make popcorn or other microwave-ready foods, but it’s useless in an adult kitchen."
1,"Pushing to start are setting times is a issue, you really have to push all buttons hard, setting the clock, big issue have to wait till 10.00 pm to set because the zero button doesn’t work. It’s for memory only."
1,"I dont understand.. This is the second time I get it delivered, Fist time came all broken, even with trash in the box. I return it and I just received a ""new one today ""  and it is also damaged.  What a waste of money . I will definitely not buy it again..."
1,"Microwave worked fine for a couple of months. Inexplicably started to smoke during use one time, and now anytime I turn it on it, immediately smells like something is burning (not food. Like a plastic burning smell). Definite fire hazard at this point. Amazon recommended calling the manufacturer, but I only get a busy dial tone when I try the number they supplied.I would look elsewhere for a small microwave."
1,Touch pad did not process the items input. Returned.
1,"We bought this for my daughter's dorm room in August of 2021...she confirmed nobody has put any metal objects into the microwave.  My wife just visited her in NYC and found out the right-side, interior panel has been sparking consistently so they stopped using it.  I just searched ""spark"" in the comments/reviews and apparently a lot of other consumers are having the same issue.  This could be a MAJOR fire hazard.  Now 4 roommates are out a microwave...$150and it didn't even last 7 months."
1,I ordered this microwave because Amazon recommended it. The control panel buttons didn't work.  I even had a friend come over to try. It just didn't work. I was hard for me to carry it to UPS to return. Very disappointed.
1,Purchased this microwave May 2021 and it started on fire.  This item was only used to heat things up.
1,"This is the worst microwave (probably appliance, overall) I've ever owned. It takes 4 minutes to heat a cup of coffee, and is super small. The turning plate falls off the stabilizer everytime I use the microwave. I got rid of my old microwave because Black and Decker has never disappointed me, and I regret it immensely."
1,Started blinking on and off the 1st time I used it garbage DO NOT BUY!
1,"This microwave will do the job, but have to push buttons 10 times before it works, doesn't heat through in amounted time packages require, you have to slam the door for a loud obnoxious sound every time and sound like it is cheap. I live and learn and should have bought a more expensive one. Pass on this one unless you are desperate."
1,Not what I expected very disappointed
1,"Awful, the deviceMoves at the slightest touch, has zero wait to it, closing and opening it is like opening the 16 year rusted garage door, barely fits a small dinner plate, barely warms anything bigger than a meatball, a bag of microwave popcorn doesn’t even fully rotate Inside(burnt popcorn no matter what), the rotation plate never ever stays on track and flies off at every possible moment. Honestly should have known better than to get a black and decker product. Their line of items are cheap and a waste of market space.Save yourself the hassle, get something better!"
1,I had to return it because it was dented  and the door would not open on the microwave
1,"Very poor quality.  This microwave oven took very long time to heat anything.  A cup of water for tea, leftovers, popcorn.  We reached out to Black & Decker and was past 1 year warranty when the device started to run while no buttons were activated, Started to shut down mid cook so you can't use it.  We upgraded to a samsung last night and will not buy black & decker products or appliances from amazon again.  Learn from out mistake!"
1,"So small that a plate barely fits. The plate in comes with constantly moves around and it won’t settle in the middle. Takes forever to heat up! It takes about 10 mins to get a small bowl of soup to warm up.  Too late to return, but I will be trashing it and buying a new microwave."
1,While heating up our food in the microwave safe container the side of the microwave caught fire after making a crackle sound and sparked.
1,"This microwave is garbage. The labels on the front of the unit are worn off and it sounds off at random after using, clearly on it's way out after 3 months. I've had microwaves last for years but this one needs to be avoided. You'd be much better off buying one for $50.00 at the ""W"" box store. Much more reliable."
1,mine had a big dent on right side
1,The worst microwave I have ever had. The ventilation does not work right and the condensation is beyond excessive. I almost burned my hand on hot water dripping from the roof. I contacted the company and got passed from person to person. I supplied all the documentation they asked. They told me it is NORMAL. Far from it. DO NOT BUY THIS.
1,I purchased this product not even a year ago and it already broke. I reached out to black + decker who was no help and referred me to the manufacture. I reached out to them and never heard back. I don’t recommend this product or black + decker since they don’t seem to care about their customers.
1,Hard to see why this is top rated since it has died after only 15 months.  Sound like it’s going to explode when you turn it on.  I guess  things just don’t last.
1,"The internal dimensions listed are not truly accurate, they measure to the recessed bump-out inside the box, not the bottom of the overall internal size. Those measurements only work if you are using some sort of elevated plate with a tall foot. When using a simple FLAT PLATE, the internal dimensions are half an inch narrower than the bump out, which on a microwave this size, makes all the difference.VERY disappointed to receive this item having confirmed that my dinner plate will fit, only to realize the dimensions they provide are not fully accurate and I actually can't fit a dinner plate."
1,"This is the only size that fits and I thought Black and Decker was a good brand but this microwave was weak to being with but after a few weeks, I opened it and it would not shut off. It runs when you open the door, very dangerous and they wanted me to call customer support at B&D to trouble shoot this POS, not worth it. Amazon should have taken a return."
1,"I just moved into a one room apartment and needed a new microwave so I thought this might've been what I needed but when I got it it takes up like a third of my kitchen shelf space and sounds so loud I could hear it out in the hallway. Already considering a replacementEdit: it's so weak and small I couldn't even put a frozen tv dinner in it without it trying as hard as it can to spin it, only to have it get stuck on the walls because it can barely fit a bowl in it."
1,"Everything was working great until it wasn't. It was used in a two-person household, so it wasn't used outrageously in the 8 months we had it, and it would regularly be cleaned. I've never had a microwave just start sparking and making a grinding noise like this one had, so it was a disappointment to see it happen after only 8 months of use. Off to buy another microwave, definitely not this one again!"
2,"I purchase for the Brand since have had many items that just seem to do well for me.This is a disappointment functionally for two reasons -1) IT SLIDES all over the counter. Why would ANY OEM build something that will live on a formica counter top with SLICK, unstable supports? I just don't get it.2) Tiny thin, writing on Black, not back lighted - Labeling. Until this product I never needed to turn the big light on in the Kitchen AND put on my glasses. Now I do.The noise put me off a bit when first started up - startled me.All of my other Microwaves, ever, had a fan noise and more of a higher pitch, light hum to it. This one is to me, 3x's as loud, with a low, very textured buzz (not a hum a buzz, buzzing - heavy running sound).It's not the least expensive, not the most costly and since I find price is not always, or even usually an indicator of ""good/not-good"" - I went with brand and reviews.I did read the, or see the reviews that state the same as I say now - NOW I understand - but just didn't ""get it"" until today - wow - what to do.Otherwise, the controls are somewhat intuitive.The times to heat are about the same or the same as on my 1200 watt unit or the prior 900 watt unit. I felt that there was no need to use that much wattage to heat water, or warm food, etc.I was anticipating the inside dimensions being ""tight"", but remain functional for what I experience with other units. So, what I mean, as e.g., is like - I'd love to heat 3 slices of Pizza same time one place as with the room or power with the 1200 watt unit. However, I often wind up doing two or even one slice in order to over all just heat the slice versus getting very ""spotty"" hot/cold not evenly warmed. Slight overlaps of slices never works and actually have burned things when got jammed/not rotate. So, the smaller footprint would seems as a non-issue, or better this way. HOWEVER, as the Manual says, allow for THREE INCHES all around this unit when using, placing it. So, it may not ""functionally"" be a small a footprint as you imagine if don't have that for air/heat which you need to take *seriously!So, anyway, it's a microwave. The door looks safe, will remain safe I hope, not sag, loosen up, etc., ""leak"" as is the warning concerning the - Door. However again, the Non-back lit Control Labels, small font/type and thin/light/hard to see AND that now I have to figure a way to keep it from SLIDING ALL OVER my counter top - SO DANGEROUS even for ""Adults"" - WOW. I looked in the box for some anti-slide thing not installed - none. I mean - where - is a Microwave EVER INSTALLED that is on a NON-SMOOTH, easy to clean, sanitize surface - ""sliddy""? Where - Black+Decker?In my opinion, that miss the mark for what I would otherwise, as first use rate would rate otherwise, 4 or even 5 stars. Then the Buzzing when running thing - is likely something that could be addressed. As with many things I see today now usually has to do with lowering the cost of manufacturing. I deal with mechanical audio and ""hear"" what they've done versus could do to quiet it down substantially.So, I hope that assists someone. Additionally, all in can say if Sliding is an issue, Small Control Labels, and Noise is an issue - take those Reviews to heart to consider - those are issues and wish I did. Yes, I could return it and may - we'll see. Who's to say what the others may be like - so... how much time to spend on this. Returns, especially with something this size are not easy for me to ""get to a shipper"" - so, consider all that is my advice and experience."
2,"so you may think you need 700 watts to run this, as it says 700 so many times, but the back of the device says on the label, 1050 input power, 700 watt output in microwave power.am I the only one who thought it was a microwave that would consume 700 watts ?"
2,"It's a fair to decent small microwave.  After 2 years of light use, it started rusting on the inside for no apparent reason.  Now 3 years later it is pretty yucky looking inside.  From the beginning it has taken longer to cook things that I had expected.  Based on the price and the nice way it fits on my counter in my small galley kitchen, it was worth the purchase price, but if you're looking for something that lasts more than a few years or if you're looking to cook bigger items, this may not be it."
2,"Have owned this for a month and I use it a few times a week. It still functions but is nowhere near as powerful as it was a month ago. For example, frozen Costco burrito microwaved the same exact way every time, now I need to microwave the same burritos twice as long for them to cook fully. Other items also don’t cook the same anymore"
2,This microwave takes twice as long to cook as packaging instructions and our past normal Microwave. Buttons are also hard to press (they must be pressed very hard to respond).Only positive is that the Microwave looks nice.
2,"Tidy size. I like the appearance. Nice that it fits tall cups even though it doesn't take up much counter space. Easy to use control panel. That said, it just doesn't work that well. Not powerful enough. We need to adjust the cooking time for everything. Even an extra minute is not enough and it heats unevenly. Most annoying was that the microwave popcorn bag kept getting stuck and not popping all the way. We found that the prime heating time was 3 min, whereas our old microwave only needed 1.45 min to pop all the popcorn. Clearly not a deal breaker for everyone, we're just sick of food with cold centers. Sadly, we tolerated it past the return window so are just out the money. Meh"
2,"I have had this microwave for almost 3 years and need to replace. I have read that microwaves are expected to last about 7-8 years(?).  The inside has started peeling/chipping and as a result, rusting. My family has complained that it takes twice as long as other microwaves to heat food (they are comparing it to the onesat their work). Its a bit loud when in use and water tends to build up easily inside , contributing to the rusting going on. I will invest in a better one this time around : /"
2,"I put a bag of microwave popcorn in and hit the popcorn button. I came back in literally two minutes, and the popcorn had burnt and was smoking. What had happened is when the popcorn bag unfolded and was now too big to rotate. The microwave is so small it cannot take a regular bag of popcorn. During the smoking there was damage. Now we are buying the larger microwave.I do think I made a mistake walking away, but I also think a microwave should be able to deal with a popcorn bag."
2,This takes 2x the time to warm food. It’s very weak. Regret purchasing!!!
2,"I like to microwave popcorn, but when I did this with a brand with large size bags, the edges scorched and burned a hole in the plastic on the right side of the microwave. The bag was too big for this microwave, so much so that the turntable wouldn't turn when it was almost popped so it stood still while continuing to pop. I had to get rid of the microwave, and took it to the Transfer Station to recycle. Be careful!! I now have a larger microwave and it works much, much better!!"
2,Too small- a bag of popcorn doesn't have room to turn. Standard plate has to be tipped to one side to fit in. Its a no.
2,"I knew when I bought this, that it would take longer to heat things than I'm used to, but it's very weak: takes over 4 minutes to boil 1 cup of water.My bigger problem is that it seems very cheaply made.  I've had this it for 3 months, and will be surprised if it lasts another 3.From the start, the plastic coating over the keypad doesn't lay smoothly, and there's a small bubble in the plastic coating on the inside of the microwave's door.About 2 weeks ago, it began to make increasingly loud noises when in use; it sounds like the turntable is the source.My advice: save your money and buy a better product."
2,"Only lasted me 3 years, part of touch panel stopped workingI have to unplug it each time I need to clear the cook time/clock."
2,"This microwave is horrible, 20 minutes to thaw out a pound of meat. Pops half a bag of popcorn then start burning it 2 minutes to warm up a corn dog.  This microwave is no good"
2,I have never used a microwave whose buttons were soooooooo hard to press. literally took all my strength
2,"Okay, so yes, it is inexpensive, that's why I bought it mainly, but you know the saying, ""you get what you pay for"". It is so difficult to click open. I dread it every single time.Also, ever single time I put a TV type dinner in there and let's say the dinner says ""cook for 2 1/2 minutes"", well, I have to add at least another minute or TWO every single time or it is still cold in some parts. That can be dangerous with foods like chicken.  But it will warm your food and your water for coffee, hit two minutes for coffee. The biggest pain is that button to open it. I have to push sooo hard to get it to snap the door open and the oven slides backwards. I have this thing now where I hold on to the top of the oven while I push the latch button. That makes me say, buy the more expensive one and hope that it is more user friendly. It will be worth it."
2,"It seems to me they should make the top higher. The inside space is small. It is low power, but that's okay because the benefit is that it draws less current. I don't like bigger ones because of that.Update: After using this 700W model for a while, I find that pressing the buttons is annoying. They are black and hard to see, and finding the right spot to press is pretty difficult. Plus, the door is hard to open as others have said."
2,A couple months in and this thing is already dying. It is also quite anemic - it is advertised as 900w but is probably closer to 600w.
2,The volts are to low!  Takes twice or more as long to cook per instructions!  Not worth the money!
2,"This works and that's about it.  I bought it because it fits the space and my Sharp wore out after 2 million uses...and they don't make that model any longer :(  This heats but is a crappy machine, a million functions but hard to use, figure out and NOT NECESSARY, just need it to reheat & heat food, oh and did I mention how loud it is?  Just and added perk... NOT!  Buy a  SHARP or TOSHIBA and get better quality, might cost more but it's worth it!!!"
2,"We have had this microwave for a couple months. Other than not needing to dirty a pot, this does not take any less time than something would on the stove. I am currently waiting for it to reheat my soup. We are at 14 minutes so far. It will not fully pop a bag of popcorn. Unless you have no other option, I would look elsewhere."
2,I previously owned an Amazon basics microwave that was perfect. I would type in times like 99 and 20 all the time. With this microwave you have to first press the time cook button before you can enter in the time. just annoying extra step. And the buttons are less sensitive than the previous microwave I own so you really have to press them firmly.
2,"So this review is coming after almost 2 years of ownership.I use the microwave about once a day to heat up coffee or left overs. Its not that powerful so it takes about 2 mins to heat up a cup of coffee and more if you're doing leftovers.Whats not good and the main reason I am posting this review is that the paint or coating on the inside ceiling of the microwave is peeling and falling off.Thankfully I cover my food w a paper towel when heating food up. Im not as thoughtful when heating up liquids. And thats what happened. A piece of the paint or coating got into my coffee.Pics for reference.To be clear, there is no food on the ceiling. That's the breakdown of the covering/paint.I am pretty ocd about cleanliness so its possible the  multi purpose cleaners I use contributed to that. I also use white vinegar. Nevertheless time for a new microwave."
2,"Our old microwave stopped functioning mid-morning and needed something same day delivery. Our older model was fantastic, lasted many years but the same replacement model was not available til later in the week and we couldn't wait that long. I relied on this company reputation for great products but would never buy this brand again-at least in microwaves. It takes much longer to defrost and cook than previous microwave. An item we defrost daily that used to take :45 seconds takes almost two minutes in this and leaves a remaining odor which previous micro didn't. We are stuck with it for now, but as soon as possible will be changing it out for our old brand. Really disappointing."
2,"I wanted a small microwave unit for my counter. I chose Black & Decker because of the brand successes.This is small, but too small for even a bag of microwave popcorn! Also, the buttons are difficult to get to respond. It takes 3 or 4 tries to get what I am pressing entered. And NOISY! OMG! is it noisy! If I could return it, I would but I've had it longer than the return policy allows. The only reason I didn't consider returning it sooner is because I figured the buttons just needed breaking in and I could live with the other issues. But, seriously, the buttons and the noise are driving me crazy!"
2,"This microwave looks great and fits perfectly in a small corner in my kitchen. It also JUST fits my largest plates/bowls perfectly. However, it has a couple issues. First, the biggest, is after using it for a couple weeks microwave lunch plates (covered with a paper towel), some spots on the inside walls formed with mold. It seems that the microwave doesn't evacuate steam from the small space well (weak fan or needs to run longer?). After cleaning the inside thoroughly, I've been leaving the door open for 10-15min after each use but expect this to kill the light bulb pretty quick. Second, the buttons can be kinda hard to press and hit or miss on responding depending on where you press."
2,Item was too small would not accommodate bacon cooker
2,Just be sure you know what you're looking for in a microwave. This is small and relatively weak (terrible at popping corn).
2,I've had it for about 6 months. The heating element is starting to go out.
2,"Okay so this microwave does the job, I actually have no complaints about it microwaving food, BUT I've never see this in a microwave, if you microwave anything with moisture or water, when it's done the water condenses all over the inside of the microwave and so there are just drops of water all over the inside, it gets sopping wet and no this is not from overheating water and it exploding, it just does this! And since the moisture just apparently gets stuck there,  the inside begins to smell rancid, it smells like urine. I clean it constantly, I have never had to clean a microwave this many times. It's so odd and gross!"
2,Looks nice and works okay but interior light stopped working in only 1 week!!!!Disappointed
2,I should have gotten a larger oven. This one is much smaller than I like.
2,"This is such a wimpy microwave. Takes many, many more minutes to do things than my old one. It’s also small, but that was probably evident had I looked at the dimensions."
2,"I bought this October 2021.Paint is bubbling, then chipping.I guess I should make sure there are no sparks!!!!"
2,"Internal specifics see below lead you to believe cavity will hold aup to 12 inch plate not the case our 10.5 inch plate would not fit in the cavity. ""Internal dimensions: 12.05” x 11.97” x 8.11” (W*D*H)"" it's there statement on the site."
2,"Hello,I am sending this message to notify you that my microwave has become a hazard and I will need a replacement. Recently when I had used the microwave, I had placed my food in it per usual, and moved away from it to attend to my work when after some time I had smelled something peculiar. When I went to go check on the microwave, I had seen smoke was rising profusely from the exits. After doing my best to clean it, it still smells excessively of smoke and when I tried to use it once again after the incident, I had seen what looked like smoke formulating inside of it. I am concerned that by continuing to try to use the microwave it may cause a fire, and I do not feel safe having it with the state it is in now. Is it possible that you could please send me a replacement? I sincerely appreciate your assistance."
2,Surprised and disappointed to find this too small for microwave popcorn.  The bag touches the sides and can’t rotate. Popcorn gets part burned and part unpopped. Found this out too late to return. 😕
2,"After the paint/lining failed, the microwave produces sparks and is failed."
2,"We moved from a house with a built-in microwave to one without. We needed a small countertop microwave for things like melting butter and reheating leftovers. Maybe it's unfair to compare this microwave to a built-in, but it takes three times as long to heat something. We are also having an occasional problem with ours where it will kind of freak out when you try to input time, and it makes the beep tone and won't stop. Pressing keys doesn't do anything. Unplugging it helps, until the next time it happens. We've only had it about six weeks, which seems to be par for the course with mass produced, made in China electronics."
2,"This is a tiny, low-powered microwave, which I was expecting.  I wasn't expecting the paint to start bubbling and peeling within a couple of months, and for the inside to start to rust along the edges.  I've had it for a year and a half now, the the paint is  bubbled and peeling on the top and bottom, and is scraped off where the wheels are for the dish.  It's impossible to clean now, and I plan to replace it.  This was not a good purchase."
2,Plate always slides off. Too deprivation. And started smoking after a year and a half
2,"Even on the highest power setting, it takes forever to heat stuff up. That said, it does eventually heat, but it took 5 minutes to heat up a 4 minute Healthy Choice meal. As long as you’re willing to mix and reheat a couple of times, this is great for small spaces."
2,"Bought this micro wave back in April of 2021, today, May 12, 2022,  it decided to spark and die.  Not sure of the life span of microwaves these days, had one before this pruchase that lasted for several years, I thought this item would have lasted longer too.This had a lot of good reviews when I bought it, not sure if this is a ""one off situation""."
2,A year and weeks in this one broke on us... buy at your own risk.
2,The display is broken. The lights for the first two digits don't show.
2,"This microwave takes 3x as long to heat anything as my old microwave. It creates steam and every time you take something out (no matter what it is), it seems that there is a pool of water in the bottom. It has no interior light and doesn’t have a reminder beep to take food out. I do like that it takes up less counter space but overall not worth it. Spend a few more bucks and get a decent microwave."
2,"1. I use the microwave mainly for warming up leftovers and meals, and for popcorn.2. I am 80 and the numbers and words are too small to see.3. I could return it, but I've used it for a week and the others won't fit in the space I have for it.4. It looks easy to clean, but I haven't cleaned it yet.At my age, I would definitely buy one with a handle to open the door, as I don't need a child lock."
2,"First impression: looks good, the controls are easy to use, the price is low.But... it has some problems. It doesn't cook evenly. The first thing I tried, was a frozen Burrito. After 2 minutes I could see cheese melting out of the ends. Nothing unusual with that.  After I cut into it, I found the center, was still frozen.Granted, this is a low power oven, so I gave it another 30 Seconds. But still the center was frozen and the ends were very hot.I gave it away and bought a GE that was a little bigger and has more power."
2,This microwave arrive all dented up. It has a huge dent on the bottom left side where the vents are. The front key pad has a large bubble under the numbers also.
2,Good size and functions but buttons are very difficult to use. Wouldn’t but again.
2,My only issue is it has a very low power level which it probably states I just didn’t pay attention lol so it takes awhile to heat things up in comparison to my last one !
2,"It heats things fine, but gets weirdly wet on the inside, have to wipe it out constantly."
2,It didn't even last a year! Horrible!
2,"The buttons are hard to use, you have to press hard on them to work. The glass plate doesn't stay in place and makes a lot of noise.  This is a mess when cooking and heating up food."
2,"Good size, does not take up too much space, but it does not heat up food well. Will be returning."
2,This microwave was smaller than I expected. I measured the space and bought the size I thought was closest but it is too small.  It holds a coffee cup. Doesn’t hold my  microwave popcorn maker.My real problem is the device constantly smells burnt. I have washed it out several times and it still always has a burnt smell.I think I will soon buy a different model that better meets my needs.
2,"It's very light, so when you push the bar to open it the whole thing moves back. Also it is not airtight. Found a spider I inside, and another between the glass and the digital numbers."
2,"We were having trouble finding a compact microwave that could accommodate our 11 inch plates. Thought this one would be a winner based on the dimensions listed online. While the interior dimensions were accurate, the actual opening of the door was smaller and the plate could only fit through if heavily tilted. Not exactly what you want for a plate loaded up with food. Outside of this, it seemed to be a fine microwave."
2,"Nice, compact microwave BUT… it didn’t even last 8 months! It sputtered, smoked and flashed and…done."
2,THE BUZZER IS LOUD AND CONTINOUS. CANNOT BE STOPPED BY JUST SHUTTING DOOR ...NOISE GOES ON AND ON.CHILD LOCK BUZZER IS A PAIN!!! NOT NEEDED.  NEVER HAD ONE ON ANY OTHER MICROWAVE.A BAD IDEA!!!! beep  beep  beep  beep  etc!!!!
2,Works well for cooking.  I dislike the way the plate does not stay in place.  Got to fix it with every use.  I dislike that the inside stays wet after use.  I would not buy this item again.
2,"This microwave is very small, it works fine but smaller than expected"
2,"Purchased it as a wedding gift for my cousin. Had it shipped to her,  it was received with scratches and a ding on the front. :("
2,"I donot like the face that part of this product does not work and I have no recourse, I have to buy another one.  that really sucks."
2,"too dam small, this will suspend all buying from AMAZON"
2,"Ive had this microwave for less than 6 months and the door button has already stopped working. You have to really ""work""  the button and help the door open with other hand. Id like a refund/replacement."
2,Umm. Product is meh. I have to go out and buy another one. Its over priced if you ask me and it took forever to get here. But it works for now.
2,"Cheap price. However, what took two minutes to heat in my old microwave now takes 6-8 minutes. I’d return it if we weren’t going to redo the kitchen in the next year. Would never recommend this product."
2,It had a dent when we first opened it up so returned it.
2,Product is totally wet inside with condensation after use
2,Stopped working within six months.
2,Again..another reason to not buy appliances on line...takes 3 minutes to warm up french toast ..the thing has no power and barely enough space to insert plate
2,I bought this for my mom as a gift to replace her old microwave and she is so disappointed. It's hard to open and not as user friendly as the one she owned before.
2,We used it to make popcorn using the icon for popcorn but it didn’t pop most of it so we add 30 second and it burned it. It makes uncomfortable noise
2,"Started beeping and wouldn't stop until I unplugged it, after only 3 days of use.  I returned it and purchased a totally different brand, directly from a brick and mortar store."
2,The picture is misleading. The one for the price is not that big
2,The tray doesn't  stay seated.  A lot of moisture  collects  in side.  Steam escapes throu door .
2,Terriable microwave:Slides all overButtons not lightedButtons hard to activate  especially  to openOnly ordsred because i could not go to Best Buy  because of the VirusDO NOT BUY
2,Worked fine for a year; looks nice on the counter.The numeric pad died after one year of moderate use.  Never had this happen before but I guess I got a lemon.
2,The right size but takes forever to heat anything. Like 6 min for one bowl of pasta.
2,"Underpowered, takes 2x longer than other microwaves. Not recommended."
2,This microwave is very very very weak. It takes several minutes to heat even a small bowl of soup and then sometimes it’s still only luke warm. If I could return this I would.
2,"This microwave has very little power and takes forever to warm up anything. I bought it for the compact size, but I didn't realize it would be so weak."
2,"Looks nice, perfect size and effective."
2,This is a perfect microwave for someone stuck in a Tiny House Nation Episode! RV & Camper owners would love this item! Everyone else buy 1000 watts or more.
2,I knew .7 cu ft would be small but this sucker is tiny. Anything larger than a saucer wont fit/spin on the microwave plate. Ended up sending it back.
2,"It’s smaller than I expected.  It may work well for a dorm, but not fir using dinner plates.☹️"
2,"I ran this microwave more than 15 minutes and it started to melt, it smelled like burning plastic.  buyer beware."
2,It was too little for my needs.
2,Weak! The things I used to cook in 3 minutes now take 6 minutes.. this micro has no power
2,Cheap. Buy something better
2,Don’t waist your money on this one.
2,Didn’t expect it to be so small!!
2,"Horrible, worse than a hotel microwave!"
2,Smaller than I expected for the pricing
2,It was smaller than I wanted
2,The interior starting smelling like rotten garbage after a while. Have had to discontinue use.
2,Item too small
2,This is a cool buy it works when it’s taken care of…it’s either your food will not be warm after a year or it will stop working in general…I didn’t buy it from Amazon but just saying the brand is giving you what it’s worth. Mines basically stopped working after a year
2,"bought this back in 2020, everything works 3 years later. But now I have to throw it out because it is starting to RUST. Around the door and the framing the door rests against."
3,The only drawback is no handle on it. Hard to open and shuts loudly.
3,"Pros: Good power, fits into the space I have. Cons:  1) The glass plate has notches that fit into corresponding notches on the bottom of the unit, but the fit is not tight enough. The plate easily becomes unstable with heavier foods on top of it. 2) The beeper sounds 5 times, even if I've opened the door and taken out the food. 3) The light stays on until I close the door. If I leave the door ajar, the light stays on until I close the door. 4) The smaller interior cavity means that fewer items can fit into the space. My past microwave fit into the same small space I have, but it had a larger cavity."
3,"The microwave is so light and the feet are not sticky.  Pushing any button had it sliding around.  I stuck a huge mousepad under it to fix it.  Um, did anyone test this device?"
3,"Bought this because of the weight, I am FM not strong with some health problems. Wished I got a different one that was almost the same weight. Size is what I expected. Easy to use. Big problem is that the glass turntable keeps popping off. Even weight on plate, plate not heavy, not interfering with it turning. Still pops off. Works with small item that is in the middle of turntable. Went to defrost chicken cutlets and had to do one at a time.  Those reasons why I put one star on easy to use and 3 stars of overall rating."
3,"I purchased this microwave back in 2020 after getting divorced. Now 3 years later, I am experiencing the paint bubble under the turntable and the strip of paint behind the door separating as a whole on the flat vertical surface. This microwave was mainly used 3 to 4 times per week and cleaned regularly. While inexpensive, I would expect an appliance to have a life cycle of more than 3 years."
3,Cooks well.. but very loud 📢
3,"I wanted a smaller microwave. This is tiny and  small portions take much longer to heat. I knew there’d be a difference, but it takes 3 or 4 times longer!"
3,"I had a tough time finding a space where this microwave could sit because the electric cord/plug is very big and bulky, in comparison to the size of the appliance.  The microwave, itself, met my expectation on size, but I had no clue that the cord/plug would be as bulky (large) as it is/sticks out as far as it does - which precludes me from placing it in a small corner location. Unfortunately, I can't return it because the box in which it arrived was ""soiled"" by painters, or I would not have kept it."
3,It's been about year. The metal is rusting and the plastic on the panel is coming off. Otherwise its functional.
3,"This microwave is on the smaller side. It’s decent, but it doesn’t heat the food evenly. One side of the plate will be hot, while the other side will still be cold."
3,"The BLACK+DECKER EM720CB7 Digital Microwave Oven is a great option for small spaces. It's compact and fits easily on a countertop or in a cabinet. The digital display is easy to read and use, and the design is sleek and modern.However, I have noticed that the heating time is quite slow. It takes longer than expected to heat up even simple items like soup or leftovers. While this may not be a huge issue for some, it can be frustrating if you're in a hurry or have limited time. Overall, if you're looking for a microwave that is small and convenient, this is a good option. But if you prioritize speed and efficiency, you may want to consider other models."
3,"The unit will heat up food. However, if you reduce the power on any level, it really doesn’t do a whole lot of anything. For instance, if you cook something on regular power for two minutes, it’ll be blazing hot. However, if you reduce it to half heat over four minutes, it’ll still be cold. I’ve tried to see if experiment even reducing it to maybe seven or eight power level. So I’m saying with my unit is that if you leave it all in all the time you’re gonna be happy. Anything else and you’ll be sadly disappointed  And take five times as long to get the same result. If you don’t go full power all the time."
3,"This microwave would probably work well if you are worried about tripping a breaker but for normal, household use, buy a different model. 700W is not very powerful. For instance, It took over 8 min to heat up a package of vegetables that steam in a bag (it normally takes 4 min in the larger ones)That being said, it is compact and easy to use. It is clearly marked 700W. If you’re retired (like me) and have extra time to wait for something to heat up, this microwave may be ok for you. If you’re like my wife/kids and impatient, habitually late or in a hurry, you’ll need something with a lot more power (like 1200W)."
3,The microwave door is too small to handle. The purchase price was too expensive compared to the other brands; similar items. .
3,"The microwave cooks fine.But the mechanical action of the ""push button door"" requires very hard thumb force and holding the whole unit in place with the other hand to stop it moving.  The latch is also Loud.The mechanical action of the keypad buttons is also difficult, requiring hard pressure and sliding the thumb around on the label to find the exact spot that will produce a Beep. It always takes several tries.Hence overall good as an oven, but not easy or pleasant to use."
3,It takes about a minute more to cook food when compared to our other microwave.
3,"I purchased this in October 2021, it is April 2023, and last night white sparks, buzzing, electrical fire occurred when I tried to heat butter in a microwave safe Pyrex cup. It was very scarey and I pulled the plug immediately. I have melted chocolate, butter, in this Pyrex for years with no problem. The silver metal plate inside has a bumpy burned surface. This appliance is not safe, is one and one-half years old, and I would like a refund, please."
3,"I gave it 3 stars because I think it's a decent microwave, and low power consumption.However, it appears to be the same innards as the Farberware in the same price range, and both this microwave and the Farberware have a time-of-day clock that doesn't keep accurate time – the clock is seriously fast.  After a few days, the clock is 8 minutes fast."
3,"I used to have a microwave made by Sharp and it lasted over 25 years. This Black and Decker lasted just short of two years. Maybe Black and Decker make nice tools but not microwaves? I think the motor died because it grinds and I see zaps that can light up a dark room. So, it is not safe to use anymore. When it worked it was fine, it was nothing spectacular, but fine. It was inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Compact, cooks fine.My biggest issue is that popcorn bags can't turn properly inside. If the bag gets stuck against the metal plate, the paper will burn. I watch the bags to make sure they don't get stuck, which was much easier before the bulb went out (less than two years after purchase).The power adjustment button has never worked, but the return window passed before I noticed."
3,Bought for my son’s small kitchen space when my husband had to go live with him and cook for him after he lost the use of his right arm & hand and left arm in an accident and had so many other additional injuries that time to spend on cooking would be in short supply. It was the right size to fit in that small counter space but they had difficulty getting things to cook to hot enough to eat in a reasonable amount of time. So it didn’t really help as much as we were hoping. Now that my son only needs the bone grafts to heal in his arm abd then physical therapy and is otherwise functioning mostly on his own except driving he’s still not finding the microwave very practical.
3,"Purchased this microwave in September, 2021.  The size was perfect for the space and fairly easy to use.  It has a little less power than what I was used to but adjusting cooking times isn’t a problem. My only problem is that the finish has chipped at the bottom of the opening.  It started to rust and sent rusty steam throughout the unit.  I have no clue as to why a chip occurred but the unit is now mostly useless.  I hope this was just a fluke with my microwave and not a problem for anyone else.  Just a heads up on the possibility."
3,The keyboard is hard to press.  It is necessary to fix the microwave oven and press the door button.
3,"glad i bought 1500w inverter, not 1000w as i though would be enough for 700w microwave"
3,The media could not be loaded.This is a great little microwave except the inside lining is peeling off. I feel this could be an environmental hazard to ones health.
3,"I needed a new ME. Wanted something simple. This had good reviews. Small. Affordable. Great. Got it. Worked fine by choosing minutes snd start.  Then it didn’t. Followed book instructions-time, minutes, power, start. Great. Worked. NOW no matter what I choose, power will not come in!  Just counts down like a timer.  Totally frustrated and ready to dig box out of trash and return!"
3,"It’s ok, but the buttons are really difficult to press and they’re mostly unresponsive unless I push super hard which is not convenient and makes it difficult to use."
3,I wasn't expecting it to be so small a normal size plate can't hardly fit in there smh.However it does the job.
3,"I was not sure when I ordered this, I needed a smaller microwave but the power on this one does not seem to be up to par with what my old one was. I am considering returning it and getting a different one."
3,"My 35 year old microwave quit, so I bought this one, over twice what I paid for the old one. It's a whole lot quieter than the o;d one, but maybe they get noisier when they get older.""Think outside the box"" is to developers, meaning how the ultimate consumer will use it, and it's pretty good in this respect, except for the turntable. It has to be lined up perfectly after cleaning, and is hard to line up. It would be really hard for someone with reduced vision, they really need to work on that part."
3,Buttons are hard to push.  Not very powerful. Takes a lot of time to reheat any food.
3,Very low wattage. Why can't the small microwaves have the same wattage as the bigger ones? I always have to guess on cooking times
3,"This unit only has rubber bumpers on the front legs, the back legs are just extruded metal.  This became a real problem when I discovered that all 4 legs are not level with each other.  Hence the unit wobbles 1/4 of an inch!  It naturally rested on the back 2 legs that did not have rubber bumpers on them, leaving only one front leg with a small rubber bumper touching the counter top.  Hence when I tried to open the door the microwave slide all over the place.  Because I did not want to hassle with a return, I did build a cradle for it, and then created a shim to level it out. After an hour of solving the leveling and sliding problem, I tried the microwave out.  Seems to work very well, and heats my coffee almost as fast as my last more powerful microwave.  Let's just hope that the only quality control issue is the lopsided uneven support legs."
3,It wasn’t very powerful and it cam with a dent on the side
3,Hard to read display without very bright light near. No light to make display easy to see. Ad on site (ref pic) makes it look different than it actually is. Misleading ad and dissapointing. Will return and choose different brand.
3,To much trouble to send bk so I will use it w/o the 7 button
3,"I thought It was low wattage when I bought It, amazon advertises 700 Watt, but in reality, It consume 1200 watt."
3,This not bad. Not worth $88.Definitely small microwave then normal ones. Better this then none though.
3,power is not enough to properly pop a bag of popcorn
3,The bottom row of numbers doesn’t work.
3,"What I like about this model:--many shortcuts and programming: I rarely have to push more than one or two buttons even for multi-step tasksWhat I don't like about this model:--when it finishes, the display reverts to clock instead of saying ""end"" or ""open"" or anything else to remind me that there's something I need to take out--VERY WEAK FAN: it does a terrible job of removing moisture from the interior, resulting in standing water that boils away and is destroying the structure of the machine. I've had it less than two years, and am waiting for the day it shorts out."
3,Got this smaller microwave for popcorn and such because I wanted to stop myself from cooking in the microwave. It seemed to fit the bill for about a month then started getting fussy. Now about every 3rd or 4th bag of popcorn it does not heat all the way so pops only 1/3 to 1/2 the kernels don't pop so we lose the bag. Don't bother. Look for another brand or model.
3,"When I ordered this microwave I knew it would be small and not very powerful.  I really don’t use a microwave for cooking, only reheating and for hot water for tea. So, with that in mind, the microwave is just what I expected.  If you need a microwave for regular cooking, I probably would not recommend this one. But, if you only need a “teapot” then this is the one for you!"
3,Makes a lot of weird noise. Beeps during run time.
3,"The microwave itself works but the packaging foam used for the inside plate protection has to be the dumbest thought process ever. The plate shattered during shipping since the inside foam is too small and still allows the plate to move around. If you do not need a microwave right away and can afford to go through the return trouble until you get a plate that's not broken, Order this!"
3,"3.5 rating my be for now.CONS:(1) After 3+ weeks of use, still I see fumes in the oven after use (most of the time).(2) and burn smell sometimes.(3) taking slightly more time than past GE one with same capacity.(4) lesser window-glass view than my last one (of same capacity)(5) the base is not rotating, I need check/research on that why?Pros:Almost same sound as the old one."
3,"This is my third one-- same model.  It's easy to use, etc.  The first lasted about three year, then stopped working.  It's so inexpensive, well, couldn't complain.  I bought it for the form factor (dimensions)  not any other reason.  Ordered a replacement.  IT DIDN'T WORK out of the box.  Great support from Amazon.  They replaced it within 2 days.  Didn't even need the warranty I purchased.  However, the B&D batting record is not very good.  I am expecting to have to juse that warranty after-all.  Still, it works and fits in the space I have."
3,"This is a well reviewed microwave all around - so I it is possible that mine was just a dud.  I returned it because it smelled like something was burning when I used it - possibly the plug or wires getting too hot.Additionally, it is very light weight, so it slides around every time you open or close it.  Outside of the defect, it is small and may work for someone with very limited space.  Otherwise I would pass on it and look for a .9cu not this one that is .7"
3,Low power takes long time to microwave things and poor performance. NOT RECOMMENDED.
3,"Ok, so I know I went the cheap route and bought this used, but I've bought plenty of used items before and never had anything show up dirty before. Seems to work fine, but at least wipe it down, please. Hopefully more attention was paid to functionality."
3,Es algo pequeño y no calienta mucho por el bajo watios
3,Good for small spaces but weak power
3,"Low wattage of 700.  Timing buttons over 5 minutes don’t work. If cooking directions call for 7 minutes, you need to cook for 4 and then 3 minutes.  It was on sale for a reason."
3,"When I try to open this thing or push any of the buttons I have to push hard bc the buttons require a lot of force to push then the microwave slips and slides all over the place. Also takes forever to warm up my food. Would not purchase this again, the quality isn’t there."
3,"Beware those customers that wanted a stainless steel to match their decor,  this one is BLACK with a silver trimer, Disappointed about that.  I haven't used it yet, I will make another review then."
3,The inside enamel broke and started peeling after about 2 years. I needed a small microwave due to space constraints. Was very disappointed considering the good name this was labeled with. I expected more from Black and Decker.
3,"I was trying to get a little microwave for simple defrosting and cooking quick frozen meals. Forget this one. Although it is the right size, and quite attractive, the power level is ridiculously low. I donated it after a week or two. My unhappiness with the product had everything to do with my ignorance, and not any fault of manufacturer. Thanks anyway!!"
3,This microwave is very small and not very powerful. I tried defrosting meat it took 15 minutes for a pound of hamburger and forget making quesadillas in it. I would not purchase this again.
3,"It may be exactly as advertised -- I don't know. However, it is smaller than I realized it would be, and I can no longer use my microwave popcorn maker (a fancy bowl) to make popcorn. Back to the stove to make popcorn!"
3,"This size of this microwave was perfect for the space I needed. I do not like the power level. It seems I have heat my food for 4 minutes or longer. At 2 minutes just the outside of my food is heated. The middle is always cold. Even liquids that I take out the refrigerator to be heated, I have to start at 4 min"
3,The only thing I dislike is that the controls take a very heavy touch to work
3,"It does everything a microwave should do. No complaints about the product itself. I would recommend it. But it is not stainless steel. It's a black microwave with stainless trim, top and bottom of window and stainless around the control panel."
3,"Well, it works. And even bigger-sized plates. I like it, but always have to remind myself to increase the time to cook since it's low wattage. Also, smoke comes out if you leave something in there for more than 2 or so minutes cooking. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing or if my place will ultimately burn down.."
3,Small compact keyboard unlit not visible in the dark  You have to hold it down from sliding when operating keyboard.  I’m up grading very soon.
3,"Really like this microwave.  It cooks and heats food thoroughly, (fairly powerful) was a good size to fit in a small kitchen, is easy to operate and attractive .  The only drawback is that whenever I use the unit the interior has a lot of condensation so that I have to wipe out and dry the unit after each use.  Don't want the build up to start to get moldy with the door closed.  Not sure if it is a design flaw or something with my unit."
3,Is has a dent on it
3,Had a broken turn wheel
3,Doesn't have a handle.  I should have checked before ordering!
3,It’s too small. I bought it for popcorn but the microwave popcorn bag is too big and it doesn’t work properly. Very frustrating.
3,It's ok for now. I knew I wasn't buying anything but a basic microwave. You have to be really careful putting any weight on the front when the door is open because it will tip forward.
3,There is not sufficient ventilation for moisture to escape.  I'm tired of having to use several paper towels to wipe out down the entire interior every time I heat something moist.  It's unfortunate because I liked the small size a lot.
3,"I think this is a little too compact and too weak for regular use. Bought this because my standard one went out of commission.I stilll have it because I use it lol and it works, but ideally something slightly larger and more powerful would be better."
3,This microwave sucks. It is compact but good grief. You can heat a plate of food for two minutes and it's half cold. Both eveness and timeliness are lacking. Pass!!
3,The first one that came was defective. It wouldn’t open at all so they had to give me a new one which has a ringing noise constantly but overall it does work and do the job
3,Very difficult to pop popcorn from a bag. Plus the cook time isn’t the easiest to figure out. It took my family 2 weeks to get to cook like they wanted.
3,Takes a really long time to heat up any food. Things that normally take 2-3 minutes tops takes 5 to 6 minutes.
3,"Cheap, wobbly -- doesn't heat evenly. Inside little square part is dark yellow burnt stain and will not come clean...."
3,"I really thought I'd found a great microwave. Yet now this thing only works half the time, despite pushing the button it won't start, even though I've checked the power and connection, the door is closed firmly, the buttons are clean, everything checks out and should work. So we have to open and close the door several times before it'll work."
3,Takes twice as long to cook foods than my old microwave. It works but not as well as it should for a brand new microwave.
3,"The turn table messes up, the inside is so small a bag of popcorn wont rotate. This microwave isnt even worth the money it costed. The power of it is minimal everything needs warmed up even longer than normal. Popcorn doestn rotate well and to cool it thoroughly you need to push popcorn button 2-3x"
3,"It's ok.. but you get what you pay for. Small, no door handle, push button to open and it slides all over the counter. Super Light weight, I bought it cause I needed a replacement fast, but I'll spend more for one in my Kitchen and move this one upstairs. It's small enough for a bedroom suite."
3,So light I have to use a teflon dish drainer under it to keep it from scooting around when I close the door.  No light on face to show numbers when using it when light is low in room.  Other than that it works as any 700 watt should.
3,It doesn't have enough power. Everything takes longer. That is my fault for not reading the wattage. Otherwise it's great
3,Nice microwave but received a dented product.
3,It’s so light that when you push a control button it moves the thing further back on the shelf. Lol.
3,Was expecting a little bigger of a Microwave. Its pretty small for the price.
3,Very low power sorry I purchased it
3,Pretty good microwave. Serves its purpose and not horrible to look at it
3,I did not realize that 700 W meant I would need to estimate the time needed to be added to instructions on packages.  So my fault that way.
3,Love it but when it gets too hot it makes these long beeps. Don't know how to stop it. But great for it's price
3,This product works great but it’s super tiny. I looked at the dimensions before I bought it but realistically not many things fit inside. So think about what you’ll be microwaving before you buy it.
3,Very weak low wattage device. Everything takes longer to reheat or cook.
3,This is not the size I thought this microwave would be it's too small is smaller than the one I had at first
3,"Very small, and not as powerful as I expected it to be."
3,It’s a microwave. It works. What else is there to know?
3,Smaller than I thought will have to replace for larger size
3,Receive microwave with a cracked glass insert.
3,Very weak power. I guess because it is small.
3,Thought it was much larger
3,Not worth the money for the size.
4,"I recently purchased the BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. The sleek stainless steel design fits perfectly in my kitchen, adding a modern touch. The 0.7 cu.ft capacity is ideal for my needs, and the turntable ensures even heating of my food.One of the standout features is the push-button door, which opens smoothly without any hassle. The child safety lock gives me peace of mind, especially with little ones around. With 700W power, this microwave heats food quickly and efficiently, saving me time on busy days.The digital controls are user-friendly and offer a range of settings that cater to different types of meals. Whether I'm reheating leftovers, defrosting frozen items, or cooking a quick snack, this microwave handles it all. It's also relatively quiet, which is a plus.One con is that the microwave is extremely lightweight, so it slides on the countertop, but that can be remedied with some 3M stickies.Overall, the BLACK+DECKER Microwave Oven is a reliable and stylish addition to my kitchen. Its combination of features, performance, and safety make it a great choice for anyone in need of a compact microwave that delivers on all fronts."
4,Gd deal
4,"I didn't read the information correctly.  It is 700 watts, but I thought it was 1200 watts.  I made it work, until I moved,  then I gave it away.  Just be aware of watts."
4,Smaller than it seems
4,I live in an apartment and it’s the perfect size.
4,"This is a very nice small microwave for the price.  Emphasis goes on small.  It is perfect for my one-person cooking, but if you want much in the way of capacity from your microwave, this is probably going to be too little.  Cooking time must be increased a bit, too.  But it's everything I needed.  It does seem to have a battery for when the power blips and will hold the clock settings for a short outage, which is handy."
4,I recommend it if you want a compact microwave that is not powerful.
4,"I thought all, microwaves were the same, buzzer sound, wrong, I was looking for 1000 watt microwave, saw the price on this model, neglected looking at wattage, bought it, and still sadly, use it."
4,"I am in a wheelchair, so I was unable to use my regular microwave machine. So, this machine sets on the sink and is easy for me to use."
4,It works and it heats up my food which is awesome.Only downside is that i can’t push the time i want. For example: if i wasn’t 2 mins 15 seconds it won’t let me. I can only do increments of 30 seconds :(
4,"Low power microwave, only 700w.  So you have to adjust must recommended cooking times.  Very dependable and space-saving."
4,"Purchased this for my child's dorm room.  So far so good.  We had another microwave that had too much wattage, but was otherwise perfect, was a little skeptical about this one, so we tested it ASAP,  We are not disappointed.  We understand that we might have to zap something twice, but as of right now, we have not had to do that and we are proud of the product.  It works and goes with he other appliances."
4,"Doesn’t take a lot of counter space, and it does its job. But it’s so light, when I push buttons on the front pad, the whole unit moves around."
4,"My mother lives in a small 1 bedroom apartment and doesn’t have much counter space. Her old microwave, which was pretty big, took up about 1/4 of her counter. So when it gave up the ghost, I wanted to buy her  a smaller one. If you need a small microwave for any reason, which a regular size plate will fit in, and don’t mind cooking stuff longer, it’s only 700 watts versus 1000, this is perfect. You know you usually have to give something up in order to get what you want."
4,"Best for this size. Very powerful, easy to use, but some minor issues:pros:a. compact but spacey inside 11 inch plate - easy.b. very easy to use (classic one button operation)c. press 1 and coldest juice is warm 12oz cup. Press 2 and it will be very hot.ventilation is good enough.(always cover to avoid problems, and to prolong it's life.cons:a. Noisy on any sound inducing surfaces; wood,metal,glass...- no soft pads under . DIYb. 5 times beep sound really unnecessary.c. Interior lamp is bright, but getting hot (it should be a led light)d. To open and close not only discomfortable, but a stone age (20 years old design),makes this unpleasant. You have to press hard a huge wiggling 'open button'...but after that, doors open-power can brake a full class of tea.Note: even with some cones it still classic easy to use (incorporating quiet a few innovations; like watt setup, that makes this device versatile cooking machine...not only warming) Highly recommend!"
4,Got it as a interim solution while we were getting our over-the-range microwave replaced.  Worked fine.
4,It’s nice and quiet and doesn’t take much space. I switched from 2000 watts to this one 700. Remember it takes much longer to warm up your food and not much space can fit. Maybe small dish is fine. The roller and plate inside is too delicate and flimsy.
4,Was exactly what I expected.
4,"The  control panel buttons are hard to push.Keep trying until you find a""sweet spot"",then everything elseworks fine."
4,"I moved to a small apt and this was the perfect size. Functions very well. I would have liked to have a higher wattage, but the size is what I needed."
4,Unit works as it should. If you are planning to cook a bag of standard size popcorn or anything larger… look elsewhere this is not the micro your looking for.
4,"This microwave is a bit smaller than I expected, but it’s not too bad. Since it’s small, the wattage is about at a larger microwave’s medium, so if you’re making anything in it maybe add an extra 45 seconds to 1 minute."
4,I’m very happy with this purchase.  It’s a good microwave.  I do wish I had purchased one with a handle as opposed to the button to open it.  But I’m happy with my purchase.
4,Nice microwave good size easy to use the only negative can not be use for popcorn bags bags to big can not turn so popcorn bags can’t be used.
4,It is a little small but works great for what I need and fits well on my counter.
4,nice product
4,Even though the sizes are given it’s better to get the bigger design this one looks like the size of a toaster oven
4,"Replaced old GE Microwave because it rusted inside, but was still working great with this B&D Microwave.  This one is really nice looking and it's hard to find a Black microwave.  I guess price was o.k. they all seem to be around this price range.  Old GE defrosted some items in 30 seconds, this B&D needs a lot more time, 2.5-3 minutes to defrost a bagel or bialy. Will try 30 second express cooking to see how that works for bagels and bialys.  I guess reheating something will also take longer so time will have to be added to that as well. I seem to have good luck with B&D appliances (toaster oven is B&D and I love it) so I'm hoping this appliance won't break down on me, however, to be on the safe side purchased 4 year warranty just in case.  I like that it's lit up inside so you can see what's going on and like the ending beep so you know food is done.  I don't find it noisy at all.  In general I will have to use it for a while to make friends with it as it works very differently than old GE.  I also like the push button release to open the microwave."
4,It is worth the money very good buy
4,El artículo está como lo esperaba fácil de usar
4,"good for work, great price. Office folks love it."
4,Keyboard is not lite. Makes it very difficult to see numbers and the other options. I have to keep a flash light on top.
4,"It takes 4 steps to heat food.Choose time, power,change power and start.  The buttons need to be pressed hard in order for options to be set."
4,Buttons are kind of hard to press but everything else about it works great.
4,"Es bueno, pero siento que se me va dañar en cualquier momento"
4,"Works well, but is smaller then I thought it would be."
4,The over works great but food such as potatoes do not cook evenly.
4,"reliable works well  easy to use  , just to small for my needs"
4,I haven’t had the unit very long but I had limited counter space of 17” wide so the microwave fit my main objective. It also looks nice and matches other stainless steel appliances. So far it’s working well for me.
4,"Quite powerful for the 700w rating. Most microwaves pull 30+%  more wattage than their label, mainly due to losses, and the outside label ""power"" is actually providing the consumer with the heating power input into the food. In this case, I believe the the ratings are inaccurate. This little unit sure does pull a lot more juice than its advertised heating input. 1280w/700w=1.68 or 68% more than the heating input power! It does heat food well however, and i would expect it to witht hat much power draw. It isn't a full sized beast-mode microwave, but will do the job with ~ 15 to 30 seconds longer operation. I would love to find a microwave that can lower its heating power (lower wattage to say half, 600w) on lower power settings, this one and most other I know of, just turn off the heating element for brief periods to let the heat even out in the food you are heating, then they turn back on and resume heating. This is observable on the killa-watt as well."
4,I wish it had more features but it’s good for the price. We put it in our office area and it’s mostly used for snacks and popcorn.
4,The power seems to be less with this unit although it's the same wattage as my previous GE unit.  Have to heat food a couple of minutes longer than I did previously.  Next time round I will purchase a unit with a handle on the door rather than a push button model.
4,It's not a bad little microwave everything seems to work like it's supposed to but I do notice it builds up a lot of moisture on just about everything I microwave.
4,"The product works great, and so far, I'm content with it."
4,Gray microwave but way smaller than I expected
4,Great little microwave. Fits nicely into small spaces.  The pre set buttons are really great and easy to use.The only downside is the door cannot be closed quietly.
4,"Very compact. Read the instructions to get a gist of how it works, takes a minute and you’re ready to nuke."
4,Thought it would have been bigger from pictures but in all great product
4,Its good to use but a little smaller than I thought.
4,The push button door opener is a little stiff and hard to open and close.  Also when you open or close the door the microwave slides backwards or tilts forward.  You also almost slam the door to close it.  Other wise a great microwave for small spaces but powerful!!!
4,"this is a pretty good microwave, but it is sorta weak so i have to microwave everything for like 1.5x longer than in my old one. it's also surprisingly small, smaller than an average microwave"
4,"Wish that the button for timed cook was easier to depress, but all things considered, this microwave performs well and offers good value for the price paid."
4,"This does great on the small jobs which is want we wanted. Exception is that it is too small for microwave popcorn and the popcorn tends to scorch. You can stop it before the scorching, but then a quarter of the bag is still unpopped. (underpowered?) Never had this problem with our previous (slightly larger) microwave."
4,lo he encontrado mas que bueno y lo mejor es que con el tamaño me resolvio algo de espacio gracias.
4,"This is a good machine, it is simple to use and works as expected.I have two minor complaints.First - the push button door latch takes a bit of force to push it in, this causes the unit to slide backwards. This is annoying when it is sitting on a free standing rack and your second hand is holding what you want to heat up.Second - For some reason when this machine is running it interferes with my WiFi. Therefore I can't use it while streaming."
4,Not as powerful as my previous unit. Takes awhile to heat things through.
4,Very nice compact microwave. Roomy inside with glass turntable. Fits nicely on a countertop.
4,"This is a really nice looking microwave for a small counter space. Because of its size it isn't the most powerful, and I typically add a minute or so onto recommended cook times. But it's reliable and sleek and good for my studio!"
4,"Delivered quickly, easy to set up and use."
4,"I got this for my mom as a replacement for her old one that broke. It's smallish (countertop size) and only 700 watts (the typical low watt ones sold today are 900, with most regular family units being 1200), but this is perfect for her since she only uses it to heat tea or warm up small dishes of food. Nothing fancy, which is perfect for her"
4,Nice look.
4,"Oy, I sure wish there was more extra capacity for square or rectangular portion-size dishes to save myself an extra pricey houseware expenditure (i.e. Williams-Sonoma in Dedham).Beth Budner, Auburndale, MA!"
4,Used mostly for defrosting.
4,Very easy to use and doesn’t pull a lot of power. Only downside is it is a small microwave good to warm up small plates not dinner sized 10/11.
4,"The ""buttons"" on this are very difficult to push.Sometimes you need to push on them 2 or 3 times to get it to start."
4,Very sleek looking! I enjoy how it works I was disappointed when I realized it was dented in the back from shipping but Amazon customer service was wonderful and assisted me with the problem. All in all the microwave is small but perfect for a small house or apartment and is very powerful!
4,"Very small footprint, but layout & buttons similar to larger models. Since it's lower power, it does take a few seconds longer. Will not hold a full size dinner plate, but our medium size Corelle plates fit. Our over-the-range model quit during the pandemic, and this one will tide us over, & then be a good extra one."
4,"As stated, perfect size. That said, it is light weight. So, you need to hold in place while you open and close the door."
4,Love everything about it but it’s too small for my kitchen but gone to keep it
4,Bought it for a housewarming party nice but too small
4,"For the price its a great product. My old micro decided to give its last ""BEEP"" so it was time for a replacement. The Black and Decker is easy to use and straight forwards. I enjoy the ""add 30 seconds"" feature adding time to be and ease. Keep in mind that this is a smaller size micro so large plates/cups are not going to fit, though average size should fit juist fine."
4,"sometimes the ""done"" beep goes off continuously while it is still running. but over all its okay for a cheap little microwave"
4,I was pleasantly surprised how easy to use it was.. Heats evenly and looks great in the kitchen. Has several functions that can be used. It's quite!
4,Good price nice looking micro efficient
4,It's how I wanted. Powerful and small size. The potato setting is not accurate beware when using that specific setting. You might need additional time. And yes it depends the size of the potato but I've tried with only smaller sizes so yes it's not accurate unfortunately.  Other than everything is good so far.
4,Only complaint is that it’s very small
4,The overall functioning of the oven is good. But the heating plate is a bit shaky
4,I was looking for a small countertop microwave and this one fit my needs.  I was disappointed to find it dented when removing it from the box.  The box was not damaged which means it left the factory like this.
4,"Todos,osea facil de usar ,facil de limpiar"
4,Nice for small areas. Works just fine
4,1 year warranty is nice.
4,Wanted a smaller microwave. This one fits on my counter. Is quiet when it runs. Really like it.
4,It looks good
4,Just too small but other then that it’s fine better for college or small apartment
4,Really good quality microwave..... great when you have limited counter space.
4,I used it as a replacement. I originally had another one in a tight spot  This one fitted in the same spot perfectly
4,"We are downsizing, so we bought a smaller microwave. But it's not powerful. It takes about 50% more time to cook/heat up the food, so it takes some time to get used to it. Other than that, it is just another microwave."
4,"It is SMALL and COMPACT.  The button for door is a little stiff. Power wattage is low, but I think I misread the stats. Great for reheats and thaw. That is why we purchased. If you have small counter space too it's wonderful."
4,This microwave is quite small. Good for microwaving small meals or reheating left overs.
4,Its smaller than I thought but it works beautifully!
4,Sent as gift
4,"Works nicely. The buttons are a bit hard at times. Hard to get them to work Overall though, a nice unitIt cooks for us, just fne."
4,Key pad is tough to use in low light. Can’t see the controls because they are not self lit. Good for hearing water for a cup of tea; reheating food; basic use.
4,I bought this for my elderly mother and she really likes it. It's the perfect size for warming up coffee and leftovers.
4,Wish I would have got a bigger one this one takes a bit longer to heat stuff up due to the size b. Works great
4,"Small, which is what I needed, but the wattage is a bit low but works good"
4,"Door closes very loudly.  Works well, though and looks great.  It's small, but now leaves more counter space for other things."
4,no issues so far.
4,Easy to use. Low power and requires longer times to cook. Fits into small space which was important for us.
5,"Needed a small micro for my daughter’s new apartment. Amazon made it easy to get a respected brand and quality product like B&D, next day delivery and didn’t have to hunt around town for a deal."
5,I got this for my son’s dorm room. He loves it. It fits perfect on top of his mini fridge. great price too!
5,I looked everywhere when we moved it for a small mircowave when we moved in to fit on our counter! There still space between the microwave and cabinets.
5,We needed a smaller sized Microwave to replace the one that died in our RV.  This was a perfect fit.  It works very well.
5,Compact size and heats well
5,Purchased as a temporary replacement during a kitchen remodel. Worked great and has decent power for size and price.
5,Very pleased with this product
5,"I wanted to run a microwave off RV battery power using a 1500W (continuous) Pure Sine Wave Inverter.  The specifications for this B+D microwave in the manual are 700W heat output and 1050W Rated Input (actual line power draw).  My inverter does run this microwave just fine, but my battery monitor displays a draw at the battery of 1375 watts when the microwave is running (with nothing else drawing power), which works out to a little over 1200 watts power draw by the microwave when one factors in the >90% efficiency of the inverter.  A far cry from the 1050 watts posted in the manual, a difference which can be critical when looking for a microwave for a low power or off grid environment.Note that trying to run the microwave at a lower ""power setting"" still requires the same 1200 watt draw.  The microwave will just cycle full power on and off, like it does in defrost mode.I am giving it an initial 5 star rating for household use, as it does everything it is supposed to do.  But I am disappointed with the misleading power spec in the manual.  I'll update this review if I run into any issues ""down the road"".  The price of this unit fluctuates, so shop around."
5,"I had to move into an apartment temporarily after a move, and since my previous home had a built-in microwave, I needed to purchase one. My counter space is limited, so I needed something small. Because of that, I was ready for less-than-stellar performance, but this unit surprised me. It's hard to believe it's 500 watts less than my old microwave, because it actually heats and cooks things in the same amount of time, like my oatmeal and popcorn. I'm very pleased with it and as long as it keeps working properly, I feel it's a great buy."
5,It works well!
5,very reasonable price ... just takes longer time to warm up food verses other ones ive had
5,"I wanted a smaller microwave to save counter space and I don't think I'll ever need one bigger than this anyway. It takes, maybe an extra minute or minute and a half to heat as much as my old big one but that's fine. It works well, it's quiet, and it looks good."
5,Good
5,"This is a housewarming gift for my son. He reported it arrived damaged, the door wouldn't open and close as it should. The box was also damaged. We requested return authorization, and a replacement. The replacement arrived a day or two later, and my son returned the damaged product. I see the return is complete. An upsetting situation was smoothly resolved. Amazon rocks."
5,This was purchased for college dorm use. Great size and light weight.
5,"Easy to use, great timing settings, pop corn etc"
5,Great product
5,"Lower wattage which work for me. It is light weight and I read reviews about it sliding when you push the button ( I prefer handle open, but price and all) anyway this will be a problem on a slick counter however a cheap silicon mat will solve this perfectly.I love the look and size. I have purchased several  black and decker small Kitchen appliances and have been happy with them, although as a wood worker always avoided there tools, I have found these to be great, affordable and stylish."
5,"Bought this to replace the same size microwave in our boat that failed.  It works much better, is quieter, and seems to draw less power from our system.  The turntable feature is especially nice in a microwave this small."
5,Purchased this for a college dorm room. University put a limit on wattage use. Just the right size for dorm fits on top of the mini fridge.
5,"In the middle of construction, needed a small microwave. This one fits the bill. It works fine."
5,"The media could not be loaded.Caught it at a great price during Amazon prime week. It is the perfect size for my counter space and goes well with my other stainless steel appliances. Don’t hesitate to buy if you are looking to get one. Good for 1-3 person households , college dorms , apartments , work office space. Easy setup all you have to do is plug it in and place the glass plate and rubber piece in the inside and ready to use."
5,It’s a microwave and it gets the job done
5,This microwave works wonderfully. I'm very pleased. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
5,"I purchased this as a component of the conversion of my 2014 Honda Odyssey to a camper van (that's another story).  The small size and low power drain were major considerations, as power will come from a Jackery portable power station.After receiving this microwave, I set it up in my kitchen for testing and familiarization.  This also provided opportunity to compare the B&D with the Sharp 1100W microwave which is a permanent feature of my kitchen.Wow!  The Sharp is the size of a Volkswagen and weighs somewhere north of a male water buffalo.  The B&D is small, lightweight, accommodates normal dishes, and is all around easier to use.  The B&D does take slightly longer to heat items, but the time difference is trivial.I am strongly considering sending my Sharp to that big dumpster in the sky and either (a) buying another B&D for my kitchen or (b) simply transferring my current B&D back and forth between kitchen and camper duties.Nothing bad to say about this outstanding piece of equipment!"
5,"Bought this for the office; small footprint, simple to work, quiet, works great.  Definitely recommend if you don't have a lot of space, but want a microwave."
5,It was a gift.  My granddaughter bought a new house!
5,"I purchased the Black & Decker microwave oven to replace my previous one, which developed a rather serious problem (smoke while cooking an item and a bright white flash while the oven was running)after 21 years. I ordered my new B&D microwave immediately after my old one failed, and have not had one bit of trouble with the B&D oven since (I have owned the new B&D microwave about three weeks or so as I write this).This is my second B&D purchase in the last few years (I have a B&D one-cup coffeemaker, my second one, which replaces my first one after the latter failed after five years or so due to what I believe was a welded thermostat), and I intend to stay with B&D for my home appliance purchases from this point forward.Black and Decker is, in my opinion, one of the best home appliance makers around; I hope they stay in business a long time into the future. As with my last B&D purchase, my hat is off to the company. They really know their business, IMO (in my opinion), when it comes to home appliances. Again, I intend to stay with B&D for my home appliance purchases, now and in the future. These appliances will always have a place in my home."
5,This appliance fits in the area I needed it in. It works very well  Does all the things I need it to do.
5,Granddaughter needed a compactmicrowave for her dorm room. Works perfectly and doesn't take up much space
5,It uses less power but it cooks/heats like a 1100 watt  im very satisfied.
5,Mom loves it…it was a gift…
5,"Microwave works as expected and also looks aesthetically pleasing. The design looks nice in my kitchen and matched many other of my stainless steel or black appliances. It works well and fits in the space I need. My family prefers a more compact, or smaller, microwave to fit better on the counter and take up less space. After my previous microwave died, I was in the market for another since I like to use one somewhat often. At first, I made the mistake of buying a microwave from cheaper brand. It was a dud, and I returned it the next day. Once I had my refund, I decided to do more proper research instead of just picking the first deal I came across. I turned to Google for research -- like most people do, and I saw this microwave on several different lists which complied the best compact microwaves of 2021/2022 and decided to purchase it. I am happy with my decision thus far."
5,"It’s the perfect size for any countertop. It’s a space saving kitchen gadget. So if you’re looking for a small to small/medium countertop microwave, this will probably suffice. Black & Decker is a reliable brand and you get what you pay for with their products. They’ll definitely give you time and remain operational irrespective of overuse and/or “abuse” aka constant usage 😉. What I found interesting is the box with the microwave smelled so clean with the scent of cherry syrup like that used to make soda. I was so surprised by the scent I remembered my childhood and bartending! A small detail yet I appreciate when packaging is done properly and the item arrives as promised. Black & Decker definitely performs QA/QC with their equipment. No bells or whistles to this microwave and I didn’t need one that did anything special. I come from a line of chefs and started cooking at the age of five. I don’t use microwaves to cook but to heat coffee and at times food. This item suits my needs."
5,"It’s lightweight , perfect size to fit on my counter under my cabinets. I love that it doesn’t take up so much space either."
5,Looks good works great.
5,Very happy with this purchase it’s compact sleek design with great power
5,"There's really nothing I dislike about it, works great for my purposes."
5,Easy to operate. You don't need a book to tell you how it works
5,Perfect size for small spaces!
5,"Love the black & silver trim. Very powerful. Arrived on time, undamaged"
5,Arrived fast and love product.
5,Just what I wanted
5,Perfecto calienta bien la comidas .es  de buen tamaño  me encantó la oferta que obtuve
5,Tambien muy elegante
5,"Our over the range microwave broke and while waiting on a repair person we needed a temporary solution. This solved that problem great. It is pretty small, and doesn't fit things our OTR microwave does, but it heats up just as well. It looks good too with a black / stainless combo and matched the kitchen and other appliances nicely. I will say it's pretty light weight, so pushing the door open button ends up pushing the entire microwave back on the counter so you have to kind of hold it while you press the open button. In the photo I posted you can see the microwave size compared to a toaster and coffee grinder. It doesn't have much of a ""frame"" so its footprint is compact."
5,Fits perfectly in the space I measured.  I am totally satisfied !
5,I haven't used a microwave in YEARS- my last one caught on fire! LOL  I usually use my Air Fryer or stove top.  I recently had a need for a microwave. bought this and have used it a handful of times and it is quiet and works well.
5,This was for my son who lives in a one room apt.  Very littitvroom for kitchen appliances. This was perfect & he also said it works perfect. Very happy with the product.I also bought the warranty for 10.99. But it has never arrived.?.
5,"My roommate and I share a house. This is perfect for us as our old one died while almost catching fire. It is smaller, but fits our large plates fine, wouldn’t fit bigger than a large dinner plate. The wattage is 700 so have to cook things just a little longer. Glad I found this deal."
5,"I'm liking the fast start with the # keypad. Hit two and the magic of tiny little waves bouncing around begins, two minutes later ding! Easy enough for more precise time entry but that's for another time"
5,"We use this microwave every day mainly to re-heat our coffee.  Still works great and is perfect for our center island shelf.  The only issue we had was that the clear covering was peeling on the buttons that we use the most but then we realized we never peeled the ""removable"" protective clear film that is placed over the key pad....Our fault.  Overall I would definitely recommend this microwave, we use it every day and it works just as good as the day we started using it."
5,"Using the power of light, this machine causes all the water molecules in your food to dance. I would highly recommend it to any fans of hot pockets, pizza rolls, breakfast burritos, or anybody who hates cooking as much as I do."
5,"I don't do full meals: hot water, single servings, oatmeal, etc. and it is fine for that. Wouldn't recommend for multiple servings at once or for meat, other than maybe a couple strips of bacon.  Works fine for what I need and gives me twice as much counter space which was what I wanted. Easy to clean. would buy again."
5,works great thanks
5,"Very satisfied with the microwave.  Doesn't take much longer to cook/heat food than the bigger one it replaced. For instance, a cup of tea takes about 1:40 as opposed to 1:20 for the old one.  Also, takes up less space on my counter.  Does what I need it to do very well."
5,"Me encanta para espacios pequeños, cumple su función"
5,"This microwave doesn't occupy much space and looks really nice. I love it, and think it's really cute looking. It has a small interior, and I have to tilt my 9"" dinner plates to fit them in, but I'm fine with that.  I use it mostly for TV dinners and to heat a cup of coffee, and cook bacon, and it's perfect for my needs. I read the reviews before I bought it and a lot of people were complaining about the buzzer being too loud. It rings four times to let you know something is done, and I don't find that obtrusive at all. It's about the same loudness as my old Amana microwave. I think it's a great machine and recommend it enthusiastically."
5,Ideal size for my needs and the size of my kitchen.
5,"It's a little bigger than a small one, but it is also the right size to put a plate in and not have it stop rotating. Haven't used all the  settings yet, but plan to use them soon. Love the weight programing and the reheating."
5,It's the perfect size for that small countertop!
5,Good product and good price
5,"We bought this to replace a much more expensive LG microwave that went kaput after two years. What we wanted: Small, quiet, buttons clearly visible without opening the door, not too ugly. This oven fit the bill to a T. The popcorn setting works great - you just have to realize there are different settings for different amounts of popcorn (which is terrific since sometimes I only pop a small amount for myself).Also, it's *tiny*. If you want to fit a big dinner plate in it, it's not for you. If you want to heat drinks and pop popcorn, and you want to fit it into a smallish kitchen on the countertop, it could not be more ideal.Another thing we like: It lets you know it's done with one series of beeps, and doesn't keep harrassing you to get your food out after that. A ver grown up approach."
5,This is a perfect micro oven to have for employee use. Small and very easy to use.  Very happy it has an automatic turn tray in it. Price was just right for the purpose. Very pleased.
5,It works gr8
5,"My behemoth of a microwave stopped working after 12 years. It was a 1.6 cubic foot microwave that was a ""mount under cabinet"" model. So replacements for it would have been between $300 and $500 (huh?). It's just me and my son and we use the microwave for heating hot water, frozen veggies/meals and popcorn! Why do I need a 1.6 cubic foot monster?!?! I tore out the old one, replaced it with a nice built-in shelf and placed the new black & decker microwave in its place. We love this thing. It is a bargain and it looks very nice works well. Yes, it will take a little longer to cook things since the wattage is less than some of the bigger ones but its no big deal once you adjust your times. I like living the simple life and downsizing when necessary.  This little microwave is perfect for us."
5,My previous countertop just quit in mid cycle. I really like having this size in addition to the 1100 watt overhead unit in my apt. I ordered this unit immediately and had it in two days. I had 800 watts before but see no real difference in this 700 watt. The price is good and it works.
5,"Perfect for my ""tiny apartment"". Very attractive/Sleek. Cooks great!!! Perfect selections....I Love it!!"
5,"Very easy just plug and go microwave.Perfect for small spaces, light and compact but fits large size plate.Spins and works great. Lots of programmable options!Really like it! Great brand! Looking forward to purchasing more of this brands items in the future!"
5,Perfect size for apartments
5,We have it at the office about a month and are loving it. To be fair it replaced a 10+ year old microwave that was decaying so anything new would probably excite us.
5,Compact microwave perfect for small spaces
5,This replaced a unit I had for about 6 years. A few reviews mentioned that the controls are hard to use. That couldn't be further from the truth. It's a basic microwave and it's easy. It does what it's intended.
5,Buen producto
5,Excellent product. The compact size fit my limited kitchen space. Easy to use.
5,"Nice little microwave.  Works well, heats food quickly.  I don’t know why it’s advertised as a 700W microwave, when it actually uses 1200W continuously, the whole time it’s working."
5,"This was purchased for an elderly woman with limited space within an assisted living facility.If you are looking for a smaller unit to primarily heat / reheat food on an average-sized dinner plate, warm a beverage quickly etc. this microwave is perfect. The speed in which it heats items of this size is on par with higher powered units. It's also quite quiet.There isn't a learning curve for basic heating.  Many microwaves require the user to push multiple buttons in a certain order just for simple heating, but this one is easy and to the point. While that's a bonus for anyone, it's  definitely a big help for someone with memory / process challenges."
5,Good quality microwave works well not noisy it's a little small inside considering the overall size of the microwave which is the same size as the previous one we had but the previous one was larger inside but the other one accumulated moisture inside this new one no problem with moisture inside no smells no accumulation of moisture so I will take the smaller interior any day over moisture and smell problems which we had with the other microwave this is a great microwave
5,"Great little microwave.  Build solid, quiet.  Good buy!"
5,I do not wish to leave a negative review but when I opened the box to my microwave today  the glass plate was smashed to smithereens! I'd really like to keep the microwave though  I haven't even taken it out of the box yet. Is it possible to get a replacement  glass plate for the microwave? I would even be glad to purchase a plate.
5,Works perfectly and gets hot quickly.
5,I bought this for a friend as a housewarming gift.  He is very pleased with it and its perfect size for a single person and small meals.
5,"I recieved my microwave on January 05, 2022 and in the time I've had it thus far, I have had no issues with it. It's easy to clean. It may seem small but don't let that waver you, it fits everything. The wattage does suck though. Often times I have to double the cook time for certain things to make sure it's heated properly but other than that, I love it. I highly recommend this product. It's surprisingly amazing for it's cheap price! I payed between $90 and $95 for it. For the price, it's better than expected."
5,It's compact and light. Love it. Perfect size for my kitchen.
5,Definitely recommend this microwave for College students. It’s small
5,"I bought this as a replacement for one I bought from Walmart. The buttons are pretty programmed for an easy cook time if it's something simple. While the one it replaced couldn't melt ice, just keep in mind that you're going to need at least a minute for the absolute hell fire to cool off of your food before you try to eat or drink. 1:45 needs at least 1:15 to cool off enough for cup noodles. Otherwise,  you're going to get burned"
5,Like everything!  Easy use and right size. It fits 9 in. Glass pie pan with glass lid so perfect for reheat
5,Had a 1000 watt microwave before but it failed. This 700w takes up less space and I like it better when heating up food. The larger microwave seemed to over heat things. This one takes a little longer but seems to not overheat (dry out) the food. I do not eat tv dinners so this may not be the best review if you are heating/cooking those types of frozen meals.
5,"This is a great product.  The Digital Microwave Oven with Turntable Push-Button Door by BLACK+DECKER performed great!  It is compact, easy to use, readable bright digital menu display and it's performance with heating up food products is outstanding!"
5,With very limited counter space this was my only option. I do a lot of baking so I can’t sacrifice space.It gets the job done. Only issue is size.A large dinner plate will just barely fit.Standard popcorn bags are too large. It rubs against the sides and burn that cardboard thingy in side the oven.Use the mini popcorn bags usually call 100cal snack packs.Also it doesn’t heat the food as quickly as my previous oven did.
5,"Perfect compact size for what I needed - no built-in so needed countertop without occupying space.I don’t need microwave to “cook” anything or heat large dinner plates, just the everyday warming, reheating leftovers etc that is too much effort to use stovetop utensils for. So the size and power is good enough.Only downside is I expected stainless steel color and finish and it’s actually black on the sides - stainless steel only in the front. So I felt some of the images were misleading/photoshopped"
5,have had this microwave oven for a year or two no problem easy to use
5,"Love this very simple, well apportioned, well made,  small microwave."
5,"Finally, a microwave that doesnt require its own area in the kitchen.  This small 700w microwave works just as well the big boys for half the space and price.  Great features.  We love the 30s and 1minute one push options.  The sound can be alittle clunky but that works for us as my husband is hard of hearing lol.  I'd recommend this for small households, dorms and the like.  Oh one thing.. we did have to kitty corner it which works out for us space wise... but if you need to brace it or when you press a button the whole microwave may be pushed out of place."
5,It has been 9 months since I received my microwave. I am writing because in just the last 2 days when we use it it smells like something is burning inside. Is there a way of getting a new one sent out and we can send this one back?Thank you
5,Compact microwave for my small kitchen. The price is perfect
5,"Excelente performance, size, price."
5,They say they liked very much
5,Super compact but still fits a normal size dinner plate. Fits nicely in a very small space.
